/**
 * This is InfoPageController class which receives
 * an input from the user via the InfoPageView, then processes the user's data with
 * the help of InfoPageModel and updates InfoPageView.
 * MVC design pattern:
 * Basically, InfoPageView class will render the view,
 * InfoPageModel class consists of dumb entities (POJO) and
 * InfoPageController class is in charge of changing the InfoPageModelâ€™s state and notify the InfoPageView.
 * ActionListener is inside InfoPageView class. When the listener captures event,
 * it passes the events to InfoPageController class through InfoPageView class to handle action.
